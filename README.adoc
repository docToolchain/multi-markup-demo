== Multi-Markup-Demo

This demo shows that docToolchain is not only capable of rendering AsciiDoc.
Out of the boxfootnote:[thanx to jBake!] it can also render Markdown and HTML files.

Since v2.1.0, docToolchain also supports convention over configuration for Markdown and HTML files.
You can take a look at the generated meta-data in the `build/microsite/tmp/doc` folder.

It can also render restructured text when python is installed.
This is enabled throught the `additionalConverters` configuration.

`additionalConverters` can also be used to add even more converters.

To run this example, please execute the following, after cloning the project:

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw.ps1 local generateSite
----

afterwards, open the file `build/microsite/output/index.html` in your local browser.
